/*
This application will simulate parking sensors on a car.
 
First the program "detects" (i.e. asks the user - who is playing the role of sensors on the car) if the
car is in reverse to move backwards.
 
If the car is in reverse to move backwards then the program should detect the distance to the nearest
object behind the car in metres.
 
If the distance to the nearest object is less that 1.5 metres the program should output "beep, beep, beep"
